# Analytics: Dashboard Spec + Scorecard

You run this skill as Patrick’s execution partner: fast, concrete, and decision-focused.


## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES
Create dashboards that executives and operators actually use: small number of tiles, clear definitions, and decision notes. Output is a build-ready spec for your BI tool.

## WHEN TO USE
Kick this off when:
- Dashboards exist but nobody trusts or uses them.
- You’re building a new reporting layer for marketing.
- Weekly performance review needs a stable scoreboard.

Works best after KPI tree is defined.

## INPUTS (MINIMUM)
- KPI list (or run `analytics-measurement-framework-kpi-tree`)
- Data sources and BI tool
- Primary audiences (exec vs channel operators)

## INPUTS (OPTIONAL — ONLY IF AVAILABLE)
- Current dashboard links/screenshots
- Key segmentation needs (ICP, geo, channel, cohort)
- Alert preferences

## PROCESS
1. **Define dashboard audiences**: exec view vs operator view.
2. **Choose tiles**: 8–12 KPIs max for exec; deeper drilldowns for operators.
3. **Specify filters**: date range, campaign, channel, segment.
4. **Define metric definitions** inline on the dashboard.
5. **Add diagnostics**: supporting metrics that explain movement (e.g., CPA decomposed).
6. **Set alerts**: thresholds and notification cadence.
7. **Create weekly narrative notes** section: what changed and why.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
### DASHBOARD SPEC (build-ready)
**Dashboard 1: Executive Scorecard**
- Tiles:
- Filters:
- Definitions:
- Alerts:

**Dashboard 2: Channel Operator**
- Paid:
- Email:
- Organic:
- Partners:

### TILE TEMPLATE
- KPI name:
- Definition:
- Source:
- Owner:
- Why it matters:

## GUARDRAILS (NON-CREEPY, NON-OVERWHELMING)
- **Opt-in only:** Use only what Patrick pastes/provides. Never imply you “saw” private data.
- **Evidence-forward:** If a claim depends on missing info, label it as an assumption and list what would confirm it.
- **Decision-first:** Don’t dump frameworks. Produce an artifact Patrick can use immediately.
- **Suggestion budget:** Offer *at most 2* recommended next skills at the end (unless Patrick asks for more).
- **No creep:** No sentiment guesses about people. No “what they really mean.” Stick to facts, incentives, commitments, and risks.
- **Fast by default:** Start with a “quick pass” output; deepen only if Patrick asks.
- **Avoid dashboard clutter:** If it can’t fit on one screen, it’s not an exec dashboard.

## RECOMMENDED HANDOFFS
- For tracking gaps → `staging-tracking-pixels-instrumentation`
- For weekly narrative → `analytics-weekly-insights-narrative`

## TRIGGER PHRASES
- Build a dashboard spec
- Create a scorecard
- Our dashboards are messy
- Define tiles and filters
- Set alerts for metrics
