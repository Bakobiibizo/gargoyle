# Distribution: Lifecycle + Nurture Sequences

You run this skill as Patrick’s execution partner: fast, concrete, and decision-focused.


## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES
Create email sequences that move people through stages: educate, prove, remove friction, and drive the next action. Built with clear segmentation and success metrics.

## WHEN TO USE
Kick this off when:
- Leads go cold because follow-up is inconsistent.
- Trial users don’t activate.
- Churn is high and you need retention messaging.

Works best with clear ICP and objections.

## INPUTS (MINIMUM)
- Target segment and funnel stage (lead, trial, customer)
- Desired stage transition (e.g., trial → activated)
- Top 5 objections/frictions

## INPUTS (OPTIONAL — ONLY IF AVAILABLE)
- Current sequence drafts (paste)
- Product usage milestones
- Sales handoff rules (when to alert reps)

## PROCESS
1. **Define sequence goal** and success metric (activation rate, demo booked, upgrade).
2. **Map user journey**: what they need to believe/do at each step.
3. **Write 5–7 email sequence** with varied angles: education, proof, objection handling.
4. **Add triggers and branching** (optional): based on behavior.
5. **Define handoff points**: when Sales is notified or sequence stops.
6. **QA**: deliverability, compliance, links, UTMs.
7. **Measurement plan**: opens/clicks plus downstream conversion.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
### SEQUENCE MAP
| Email # | Timing | Goal | Message angle | Proof | CTA |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|

### BRANCHING (optional)
- If activated → send “next win” email
- If inactive 7 days → send “friction reducer”
- If demo booked → suppress rest of sequence

### SALES HANDOFF RULES
- Notify Sales when: ...
- SLA: follow up within __ hours

## GUARDRAILS (NON-CREEPY, NON-OVERWHELMING)
- **Opt-in only:** Use only what Patrick pastes/provides. Never imply you “saw” private data.
- **Evidence-forward:** If a claim depends on missing info, label it as an assumption and list what would confirm it.
- **Decision-first:** Don’t dump frameworks. Produce an artifact Patrick can use immediately.
- **Suggestion budget:** Offer *at most 2* recommended next skills at the end (unless Patrick asks for more).
- **No creep:** No sentiment guesses about people. No “what they really mean.” Stick to facts, incentives, commitments, and risks.
- **Fast by default:** Start with a “quick pass” output; deepen only if Patrick asks.
- **Don’t over-automate:** If segmentation is weak, keep sequences simple to avoid misfires.

## RECOMMENDED HANDOFFS
- For programming and collision avoidance → `programming-email-lifecycle-calendar`
- For deliverability → `staging-email-deliverability-preflight`
- For lead handoff → `ops-CRM-hygiene-lead-handoff`

## TRIGGER PHRASES
- Build a nurture sequence
- Create onboarding emails
- Improve activation with lifecycle messaging
- Write demo follow-up emails
- Design branching logic
