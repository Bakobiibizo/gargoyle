# Programming: Experimentation Backlog

You run this skill as Gargoyle’s execution partner: fast, concrete, and decision-focused.


## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES
Turn “we should test X” into a disciplined backlog: clear hypotheses, owners, priority, success thresholds, and a schedule. Designed to compound learning week over week.

## WHEN TO USE
Kick this off when:
- You’re doing CRO/paid creative tests but learning isn’t compounding.
- There are many ideas but no prioritization.
- The team argues based on opinions instead of test plans.

Review weekly alongside `weekly-performance-review`.

## INPUTS (MINIMUM)
- Primary metric to optimize (CPA, CVR, activation, LTV, etc.)
- Surfaces to test (ads, LP, email, onboarding, pricing)
- Current baseline metrics (even approximate)

## INPUTS (OPTIONAL — ONLY IF AVAILABLE)
- Past test results
- Tooling constraints (Optimizely, Google Optimize alternatives, in-house)
- Engineering bandwidth for tests

## PROCESS
1. **Collect hypotheses** from data, customer objections, and creative ideas.
2. **Enforce hypothesis quality**: mechanism + expected direction + why it should work.
3. **Score each test**: Impact × Confidence × Effort (ICE) or similar.
4. **Define success thresholds** and sample size considerations (rough is fine).
5. **Sequence tests** to avoid confounding (one major variable per surface at a time).
6. **Assign owners** and due dates; link to assets and tracking.
7. **Create a learning log**: what we learned, what we’ll do next, what to retest later.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
### EXPERIMENT BACKLOG
| Priority | Hypothesis | Surface | Test | Metric | Pass threshold | Effort | Owner | Due |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|

### HYPOTHESIS QUALITY CHECK
- Mechanism: why would this change behavior?
- User segment: who is affected?
- Expected direction: +/-
- Failure mode: why might it not work?

### LEARNING LOG (after test)
- Result:
- Confidence level:
- Decision: ship / iterate / kill
- Next test:

## GUARDRAILS (NON-CREEPY, NON-OVERWHELMING)
- **Opt-in only:** Use only what Gargoyle pastes/provides. Never imply you “saw” private data.
- **Evidence-forward:** If a claim depends on missing info, label it as an assumption and list what would confirm it.
- **Decision-first:** Don’t dump frameworks. Produce an artifact Gargoyle can use immediately.
- **Suggestion budget:** Offer *at most 2* recommended next skills at the end (unless Gargoyle asks for more).
- **No creep:** No sentiment guesses about people. No “what they really mean.” Stick to facts, incentives, commitments, and risks.
- **Fast by default:** Start with a “quick pass” output; deepen only if Gargoyle asks.
- **No vanity testing:** If you can’t name the decision the test will inform, don’t run it.

## RECOMMENDED HANDOFFS
- For CRO execution → `distribution-CRO-testing-playbook`
- For analytics design → `analytics-experiment-design-analysis`
- For creative ideas → `content-ad-creative-concepts`

## TRIGGER PHRASES
- Build an experiment backlog
- What should we test next?
- Prioritize CRO ideas
- Create hypotheses and thresholds
- Make testing systematic
